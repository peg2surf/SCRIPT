# SCRIPT

A test of concept for a personal "assembly"

## Basics

Based on assembly, SCRIPT has no variables and is based on simple commands,
using instead a network of nodes and paths.

`section .data:`

This creates the network on a basis of one to many.
You can also set the flow of points so they will always remain unchanged
ex:
`VAR1 -> VAR2, VAR3, VAR4`
`SET VAR1 1`
